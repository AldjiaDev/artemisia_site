        The Art of<br>
        Artemisia<br>
        Gentileschi
      </h1>

      <!-- Chapo -->
      <p class="works-chapo">
        Powerful heroines, dramatic chiaroscuro, and scenes charged with emotion —
        Artemisia Gentileschi created some of the most striking images of the
        Italian Baroque.
      </p>

      <!-- Texte éditorial -->
      <div class="works-body">
        <p>
          Artemisia’s work is instantly recognisable: strong contrasts of light and
          shadow, expressive gestures, and a deep psychological intensity. Her
          paintings confront the viewer with women who act, resist, decide — and
          whose presence fills the canvas.
        </p>

        <p>
          Trained in the workshop of her father Orazio, and influenced by
          Caravaggio’s naturalism, she quickly forged a visual language that was
          unmistakably her own. Her compositions are bold, theatrical, and often
          anchored in female solidarity.
        </p>

          Themes and techniques
        </h2>

        <p>
          Artemisia explored themes such as courage, justice, and vulnerability.
          Her mastery of chiaroscuro heightens emotion, while her attention to
          physical detail brings a unique realism to her storytelling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Far from depicting passive figures, Artemisia paints heroines who take
          centre stage — Judith, Susanna, Jael, Cleopatra, and even herself in
          several powerful self-portraits.
