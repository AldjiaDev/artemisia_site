        From London to Naples, Rome and beyond, museums have devoted major
        exhibitions to Artemisia Gentileschi — revealing the strength, drama
        and sensitivity of her painting to new generations of visitors.

          Major retrospectives
        </h2>
        <p>
          In 2020, the National Gallery in London presented a landmark exhibition
          simply titled <em>Artemisia</em>. Bringing together masterpieces from
          across Europe, it placed her at the centre of Baroque painting, rather
          than on the margins of art history. Visitors encountered iconic works
          such as <em>Judith Slaying Holofernes</em>, <em>Susanna and the Elders</em>
          and striking self-portraits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other institutions have followed, offering monographic exhibitions that
          trace her journey from Rome to Florence, Venice, Naples and London.
          These shows often combine paintings with letters, documents and new
          research, giving a richer sense of her life and context.
        </p>

          Thematic exhibitions
        </h2>
        <p>
          Group exhibitions have also highlighted Artemisia’s place among her
          contemporaries. Shows devoted to Baroque heroines, women artists of the
          seventeenth century or the legacy of Caravaggio have all included her
          works, placing her alongside painters such as Orazio Gentileschi,
          Caravaggio and others.
        </p>

        <p>
          In these contexts, Artemisia’s paintings often stand out for the
          intensity of their storytelling and the presence of their female
          figures, who are depicted not as passive muses but as protagonists.
        </p>

        <h2 class="exhibitions-section-title mt-4">
          A living legacy
        </h2>
        <p>
          Today, exhibitions dedicated to Artemisia attract large audiences and
          generate conversations well beyond museum walls. Her story resonates
          with contemporary discussions about gender, power and representation,
          while her paintings continue to fascinate for their beauty and
          emotional impact.
        </p>

        <p>
          For many visitors, discovering Artemisia in an exhibition is not just
          an encounter with a historical figure, but with a voice that still
          speaks clearly across the centuries.
