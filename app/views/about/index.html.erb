        Painter of light and shadow, master storyteller of the Italian Baroque,
        Artemisia Gentileschi brought to life heroines whose courage, dignity
        and strength continue to resonate today.
      </p>

      <!-- Texte principal -->
      <div class="about-body">
        <p>
          Born in Rome in 1593, Artemisia Gentileschi was trained in the workshop
          of her father, Orazio Gentileschi, a follower of Caravaggio. From an early
          age she learned to handle strong contrasts of light and shadow, bold
          compositions and unusually intense facial expressions — elements that would
          later define her mature style.
        </p>

        <p>
          While many women of her time were confined to domestic roles, Artemisia
          entered the professional world of painting. At only seventeen, she produced
          works such as <em>Susanna and the Elders</em>, already marked by a striking
          sense of psychological tension and a clear empathy for her female subjects.
        </p>

          Trials and recognition
        </h2>

        <p>
          In 1612, Artemisia became the centre of a highly publicised rape trial
          after accusing the painter Agostino Tassi. The trial was brutal; she was
          subjected to torture to “verify” her testimony. Yet she persisted, determined
          to defend both her honour and her truth. This episode, though often used to
          define her, is only one part of a much larger story.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shortly after, Artemisia moved to Florence, where she was admitted to the
          Accademia delle Arti del Disegno — a remarkable achievement for a woman at
          the time. She worked for powerful patrons, including the Medici, and
          developed a personal signature: monumental women, vivid colours and scenes
          filled with dramatic tension.
        </p>

        <h2 class="about-section-title mt-4">
          Her heroines
        </h2>

        <p>
          In paintings such as <em>Judith Slaying Holofernes</em>, <em>Judith and her
          Maidservant</em>, <em>Jael and Sisera</em> or her numerous self-portraits,
          Artemisia gives her female figures an agency that was rare in Baroque art.
          These women are not passive muses. They act, decide, resist and sometimes
          strike back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through these heroines, Artemisia explores questions of justice, power,
          vulnerability and courage. Their gestures, their gaze and their physical
          presence carry a weight that feels profoundly contemporary — which explains
          why her work resonates so strongly with today’s audiences.

          A rediscovered legacy
        </h2>

        <p>
          For centuries, Artemisia’s name was overshadowed by that of her father and
          male contemporaries. It is only in the twentieth century, and especially
          from the 1970s onwards, that scholars and artists began to re-examine her
          oeuvre and recognise her as one of the major painters of the Baroque.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, major museums dedicate exhibitions to her, her paintings travel
          across the world, and her story inspires books, films and new artworks.
          Artemisia Gentileschi is no longer just a footnote in art history; she is a
          central figure — a model of artistic mastery, resilience and unapologetic
          creativity.
